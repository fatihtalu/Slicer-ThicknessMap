# ThicknessMap
This module is an extention for 3D Slicer.  It was implemented to generate Thickness Maps of 3D segments obtained from MRI-CT data.  First, select a Volume (MRI-CT). Then, using 'Apply Segmentation' button, set a threshold value to determine a segment in the volume.  Finally, generate the map by clicking the Apply Thickness button.
