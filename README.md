# ThicknessMap
This module is an extention for 3D Slicer.  
It was implemented to generate Thickness Maps of 3D segments obtained from MRI-CT data.  

# Using Extension
1) Load a MRI or CT data to 3D Slicer.
2) Open the Thickness Map extention
3) Select a 3D Volume (loaded vol.)
4) Set a threshold value to get a segment from the 3d Volume
5) Click the Apply Segmentation button to see the segmentation result (You can try updating the threshold)
6) Click the Apply Thickness button to generate Thickness Map model of the segment
